# Water-Quality-prediction-System-using-Machine-Learning-and-Flask
Led the development of a web application utilizing machine learning (Python) to predict water  quality. Implemented multiple models (analytical skills) to identify the most accurate solution. Designed a user-friendly interface (front-end development - HTML, CSS,JavaScript) for data input  and real-time predictions.
